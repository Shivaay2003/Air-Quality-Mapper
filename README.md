# Information Visualization: COVID-19's Impact on the Environment
# Air-Quality-Mapper

## Overview

This project analyzes how COVID-19 pandemic restrictions affected environmental conditions, specifically focusing on changes in air quality relative to COVID-19 infection rates. By aligning datasets on air quality and COVID-19 cases, we aim to identify patterns that reveal the pandemic's impact on the environment, particularly through lockdowns and other restrictive measures.

## Data Sources

- **Delhi Air Quality Index Data**: [AQICN Delhi](https://aqicn.org/city/delhi)
- **COVID-19 India Data**: [COVID-19 India](https://data.covid19india.org/)

*Note*: Although the official API for COVID-19 data was deprecated due to regulatory changes, reliable datasets from multiple sources remain accessible on the website for analysis.

## Data Description

The project uses two main datasets covering **January 30, 2020, to October 31, 2021**:
- **COVID-19 Case Data**
- **Air Quality Index Data**

The data has been preprocessed and aligned by date to enable clear comparative analysis.

## Project Components

1. **Power BI Graphs**: These graphs allow for an interactive exploration of trends between COVID-19 cases and air quality changes.
2. **Tableau Visualizations**: Dynamic visualizations that show environmental patterns across pandemic phases.
3. **Video Presentation**: A video walkthrough summarizing project insights and highlighting major findings on the air quality impact.
4. **PowerPoint Presentation**: A structured, slide-based presentation covering objectives, methodology, and key insights, useful for delivering concise summaries in formal settings.

## Key Insights

- **Lockdown Phases**: Significant improvements in air quality were observed during strict lockdowns, linked to reduced mobility and industrial activities.
- **Transition Phases**: Air quality began to fluctuate as restrictions eased, though in many cases remained below pre-pandemic pollution levels.
- **Seasonal Insights**: When overlaid with seasonal pollution trends, the data provides insight into how reduced human activity affected usual environmental patterns, particularly in areas with high seasonal pollution.

This project encourages a deeper understanding of the link between human activity and environmental health, potentially offering insights for future environmental and health policy decisions.
