# 🌍 COVID-19’s Impact on the Environment 🌿

---

## 📝 **Overview**

This project explores the environmental changes during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on how lockdowns and reduced human activity affected **air quality** over time. By comparing **infection rates** and **air quality data**, we can see how restrictions may have positively impacted environmental conditions.

## 📊 **Data Sources**

- **Delhi Air Quality Index (AQI)**: [AQICN Delhi](https://aqicn.org/city/delhi) – Provides real-time AQI readings for Delhi.
- **COVID-19 India Statistics**: [COVID-19 India](https://data.covid19india.org/) – A comprehensive dataset on COVID-19 cases across India.

> *Note*: Although the official COVID-19 API was discontinued, authentic data from reliable sources is still available on the website.

## 📅 **Data Description**

The project combines data from **January 30, 2020, to October 31, 2021**, bringing together:

- **COVID-19 Case Data** – Daily case counts, providing a timeline of infection trends.
- **Air Quality Index (AQI) Data** – Daily AQI values, capturing environmental conditions during pandemic phases.

The datasets are synchronized by date, allowing us to clearly observe and analyze the interaction between infection rates and air quality changes.

## 🔍 **Key Insights**

- **Lockdown Impact** 🚫: A noticeable improvement in air quality during strict lockdowns, with pollution levels dropping as human activity slowed.
- **Post-lockdown Trends** 🔄: As restrictions eased, pollution levels began to rise, yet in some cases remained lower than pre-pandemic averages.
- **Seasonal Observations** 🍃: Seasonal trends, like high winter pollution, were altered during the pandemic, providing a unique look at how reduced activity affected typical environmental patterns.

This project sheds light on the environmental consequences of pandemic-induced behavior changes, offering valuable insights into the relationship between human activity and air quality.
